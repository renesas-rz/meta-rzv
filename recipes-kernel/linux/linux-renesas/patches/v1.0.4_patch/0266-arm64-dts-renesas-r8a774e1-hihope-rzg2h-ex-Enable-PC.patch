Subject: [PATCH 266/309] arm64: dts: renesas: r8a774e1-hihope-rzg2h-ex: Enable
 PCIE1

and set PCIe as a default instead of SATA

This patch enables PCIE1 for the HiHope board

In RZ/G2H, we can choose the output between PCIE1 and SATA by
GP7_03 and SW43=OFF with following selections:

GPIO7_03 = HIGH -> PCIE1
GPIO7_03 = LOW -> SATA
Currently, we enable PCIE1 as default environment.
