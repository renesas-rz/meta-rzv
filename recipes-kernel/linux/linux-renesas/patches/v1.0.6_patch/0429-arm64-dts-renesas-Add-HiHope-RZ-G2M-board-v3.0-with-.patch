Subject: [PATCH 429/443] arm64: dts: renesas: Add HiHope RZ/G2M board v3.0
 with idk-1110wr display

The HiHope RZ/G2M v3.0 is advertised as compatible with panel idk-1110wr
 from Advantech, however the panel isn't sold alongside the board.
 A new dts, adding everything that's required to get the panel to
 work the HiHope RZ/G2M v3.0, is the most convenient way to support the
 HiHope RZ/G2M v3.0 when it's connected to the idk-1110wr.
